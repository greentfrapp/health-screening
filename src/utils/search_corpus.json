   "General Population Recommendation": "All normal risk, asymptomatic women 50 to 69 years of age should be screened with mammography only, every 2 years.",
   "Individual Recommendation": "",
   "Notes": "The underlying premise for breast cancer screening is that it allows for the detection of breast cancers before they become palpable. Small tumours are more likely to be early stage disease, having better prognosis, and are more successfully treated.\nMammography-based screening is widely accepted as appropriate and beneficial for women above the age of 50. Combined analysis of eight prospective randomized clinical trials suggest that screening mammography produced a mortality benefit of approximately 22% for women aged 50 to 69 years old in populations invited to screening. For women aged 40 to 49, there is great variation on recommendations for mammographic screening. The additional mortality benefit is small for initiating screening at 40 instead of 50 years old, although it saves more life-years at a population level. The peak incidence of breast cancer in Singapore also continues to shift towards 60 years old. The recommendations for the 40 to 49 years old age group in Singapore are based on a balance between international guidelines and practice, the low incidence, higher costs and higher false positive rate of mammographic detection in this age group.\nClinicians should discuss with women at normal risk aged 40 to 49 years old about the potential benefits, limitations and harms associated with screening mammography so that an informed choice can be made about attending breast cancer screening. They should base screening mammography decisions on the benefits and harms of screening, as well as on the woman’s preferences and breast cancer risk profile. If screening is to be performed, it should be done annually.\nPotential risks of mammography include false-positive results, diagnosis and treatment for cancer that would not have become clinically evident during the patient's lifetime (over diagnosis), radiation exposure, false reassurance, and procedure-associated problems. False-positive mammography can lead to increased anxiety and to feelings of increased susceptibility to breast cancer, as well as unnecessary diagnostic tests. Women with false negative mammograms may be given false assurance. Up to one-fourth of all invasive breast cancers are not detected by mammography in 40 to 49 years old, compared with one-tenth of breast cancers in 50 to 69 years old. The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer may be delayed because of a \"normal\" mammogram.",

   "Notes": "The USPSTF recommends vision screening for all children at least once between the ages of 3 and 5 years, to detect the presence of amblyopia or its risk factors. The most common causes of vision impairment in children are amblyopia and associated risk factors (strabismus, anisometropia, astigmatism, and hyperopia) and refractive errors not associated with amblyopia.\nIn its assessment, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment for amblyopia or unilateral refractive errors is associated with moderate improvements in visual acuity for children 3 to 5 years of age and, in theory, permanent improvements throughout life. Although the average improvement in visual acuity resulting from treatment for amblyopia was ~1 line on a Snellen eye chart, the USPSTF concluded that the benefits are moderate because untreated amblyopia results in permanent, uncorrectable vision loss and the potential benefits are experienced over the individual's life span. Harms from treatment seem to be minimal. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate.\nUnder the National Myopia Prevention Programme under the auspices of the Health Promotion Board, yearly vision screening is conducted for Kindergarten 1 and Kindergarten 2 students in all pre-schools. For the primary and secondary students, visual acuity screening is conducted as part of the annual health screening by the School Health Service. Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) vision screening and colour vision screening are performed on all Primary 1 children.",

   "Notes": "In women with high genetic risk for breast cancer, MRI breast screening is performed annually as an adjunct to mammography as studies have shown that MRI detects more cancers (with a sensitivity of 71% to 100%) compared to mammography (sensitivity 25% to 40%). Mammogram screening should still be performed with MRI as some cancers which manifest as micro-calcifications on mammography may not be detected on MRI. MRI cannot replace mammographic screening in these women as some cancers may manifest as micro-calcifications which may not be shown on MRI.\nScreening should start at age 25 to 30 years for women with gene mutations conferring high risk of developing breast cancer and their untested first degree relatives. In those with strong family history of breast cancer but no proven mutation, screening is recommended to commence as early as 5 to 10 years prior to the age of onset in the youngest family member to contract breast cancer, but not earlier than age 25 to 30.\nWomen who received radiation treatment to the chest, such as for Hodgkin disease, are also at high risk for developing breast cancer.\nDiagnosis of breast cancer occurred at a mean of 18 years after diagnosis of Hodgkin disease with a range of 7 to 30 years. Although there is a lack of evidence with regards to MRI screening in this group, there is consensus opinion that MRI screening commencing 8 years after radiotherapy to the chest may offer similar benefit as for women with a strong family history.\nThere is not enough data demonstrating clinical benefit for MRI screening in women with moderate risk of breast cancer (15 to 20% lifetime risk), e.g. personal history of breast cancer, prior biopsy with atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular neoplasia. Hence, no specific MRI screening recommendation is made for these women.\nBreast MRI is not suitable for routine breast screening of women who are at normal risk of developing breast cancer. However, in women with diffuse breast injection augmentation, particularly of the free silicone type, the injected material may significantly obscure mammographic and sonographic visibility of the underlying breast tissue. This renders mammogram and ultrasound assessments ineffective for breast cancer screening. Hence MRI should replace mammogram screening in these cases. The recommended age and frequency of screening are similar to the mammogram screening guidelines for normal risk women.",

   "Notes": "Low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) refers to a non-contrast study obtained with a multidetector CT scanner during a single maximal inspiratory breath-hold. Radiation dose exposure is less than a third of a standard-dose diagnostic chest CT scan. Several cohort studies and randomized control trials have demonstrated that screening was significantly more sensitive than chest radiograph in identifying early stage, asymptomatic lung cancers. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large randomized trial of screening LDCT in high-risk individuals, demonstrated a lung cancer mortality benefit of 20%, with all-cause mortality reduced by 6.7%. Many expert screening groups have incorporated results from the NLST in their recommendations, and generally suggested annual screening until high-risk individuals are no longer eligible for definitive treatments.\nHowever, this has to be balanced with the unnecessary exposure to radiation, financial costs of CT screening, and a high rate of false positive findings. These may further lead to implications of further evaluation, such as the potential for morbidity and mortality from invasive procedures like a lung biopsy.\nThere is also an increasing incidence of lung adenocarcinoma in the Singapore population. The rate of lung carcinoma is also higher compared to United States and other western countries where the largest lung cancer screening trials were conducted. This reflects the Asia-pacific trend of higher rates of adenocarcinoma, particularly in women and also in non-smokers. This may be due to a fundamental difference in genetic predisposition amongst Chinese non-smokers to lung adenocarcinoma, as well as the effects from exposure to environmental risk factors. Further evidence is required from local population research so that any causative link between lung adenocarcinoma and the East Asian female and/or never-smoker phenotype can be established in the local context so that future screening guidelines can include these as risk factor targets for lung cancer screening.",

   "Notes": "Due to the uncertainty that PSA testing results in more benefit than harm, a thoughtful and broad approach to PSA is critical. The decision to use PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer should be individualised. Patients need to be informed of the risks and benefits of testing before it is undertaken.\nProstate cancer survival is related to many factors, especially the extent of tumour at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year relative survival among men with cancer confined to the prostate (localised) or with just regional spread is 100%, compared with 31.9% among those diagnosed with distant metastases. While men with advanced stage disease may benefit from palliative treatment, their tumours are generally not curable.\nAlthough prostate biopsies rarely cause complications serious enough to require hospitalisation, screening is not an entirely benign process and may be associated with discomfort and possible complications of biopsy. In addition, false-positive results have a psychological cost. Chronic anxiety can also follow a negative prostate biopsy because this apparently favourable result cannot completely rule out prostate cancer given the relatively high false-negative biopsy rate.",

Therefore, surveillance of these patients with magnetic resonance angiography may be justified. Patients with a prior history of cerebral aneurysms have a higher rate of future de novo aneurysm formation and should be screened at 5-year intervals.\nScreening should also be considered in patients with some rare conditions (e.g., autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) that are associated with an increased risk of aneurysms.\nPatients with one affected first-degree relative should be differentiated from those with more than one such relative.

   "Notes": "A national Hepatitis B seroprevalence study was conducted in 2010 to assess the seroprevalence of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) markers in our adult population in Singapore and a comparison was made with the seroprevalence in 1998 and 2004.\nThe overall Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among Singapore residents aged 18 to 69 years has remained stable, from 4.0% (1998) to 2.7% (2004) and 3.6% (2010), and was within the range of intermediate HBV endemicity; the overall population immunity to HBV was 43.9%.\nWhile the national childhood HBV immunisation and catch-up programmes implemented in 1987 and 2001 to 2004 respectively, had a significant impact in reducing HBV infection and in raising the immunity of the local adult population 18 to 29 years of age, the prevalence of HBV infection in age groups 30 and above have increased from 2004 to 2010. Hence, it is recommended for all normal risk, asymptomatic adults with no known Hepatitis B carrier status born before 1987 and did not undergo the catch-up immunisation programmes from 2001 to 2004 to be screened for Hepatitis B.\nThe USPSTF found good evidence that universal prenatal screening for HBV infection using HBsAg substantially reduces prenatal transmission of HBV and the subsequent development of chronic HBV infection. The current practice of vaccinating all infants against HBV infection and post exposure prophylaxis with Hepatitis B immune globulin administered at birth (within 12 hours) to infants of HBV-infected mothers substantially reduces the risk for acquiring HBV infection.\nExposure-prone procedures refer to those invasive procedures where there is a risk that injury to the worker may result in exposure of the patient’s open tissues to the blood of the worker. These procedures include those where the worker’s gloved hands may be in contact with sharp instruments, needle tips or sharp tissues (e.g. spicules of bone or teeth) inside a patient’s confined anatomical space where the hands or fingertips may not be completely visible at all times, open body cavity, or wound.

   "Notes": "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends that clinicians should screen for HIV in all adolescents, adults at increased risk for HIV infection and all pregnant women.\nThe USPSTF found good evidence that appropriately timed interventions, particularly Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), lead to improved health outcomes for many of those screened, including reduced risk for clinical progression and reduced mortality. Since false-positive test results are rare, harms associated with HIV screening are minimal. Potential harms of true-positive test results include increased anxiety, labeling, and effects on close relationships. Most adverse events associated with HAART, including metabolic disturbances associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, may be ameliorated by changes in regimen or appropriate treatment.\nThe USPSTF concluded that the benefits of screening individuals at increased risk substantially outweigh potential harms.\nThe USPSTF also found good evidence that introduction of universal prenatal counselling and voluntary testing increases the proportion of HIV-infected women who are diagnosed and are treated before delivery. There is good evidence that recommended regimens of HAART are acceptable to pregnant women and lead to significantly reduced rates of mother-to-child transmission.\nEarly detection of maternal HIV infection also allows for discussion of elective caesarean section if viral load cannot be suppressed before delivery and avoidance of breastfeeding, both of which are associated with lower HIV transmission rates.\nThere is no evidence of an increase in foetal anomalies or other foetal harm associated with currently recommended antiretroviral regimens (with the exception of efavirenz). Serious or fatal maternal events are rare using currently recommended combination therapies. The USPSTF concluded that the benefits of screening all pregnant women substantially outweigh potential harms.\nHIV infection is a known risk factor for progression from latent TB infection to TB disease. Progression to TB disease is often rapid among people infected with HIV and can be deadly. In addition, TB outbreaks can rapidly expand in patient groups infected with HIV. When HIV is diagnosed early, appropriately timed interventions can lead to improved health outcomes, including slower progression and reduced mortality.",

The benefits of QUS include portability, not exposing patients to radiation, and being less expensive.\nHowever, there is limited application for QUS in screening due to its low sensitivity for detecting osteoporosis. Also, T-scores on different QUS machines are not directly translatable to DXA T-scores based on WHO classification. Since DXA T-scores are well validated for diagnosis and prognosis, a low T-score on QUS heel would still require subsequent DXA scanning to confirm the diagnosis. Locally, the normative databases for Singaporeans for QUS machines have not been established and there are no agreed upon criteria. In addition, there is good access to DXA scanning in Singapore.",
